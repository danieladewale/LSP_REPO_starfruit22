## AI-Generated Content

### Claude AI Assistance
I used Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant) via Claude Code to help implement this assignment.

**Tool Used**: Claude Code (VS Code Extension)
**Model**: Claude Sonnet 4.5
**Date**: October 20, 2025

**How Claude was used**:
- Assisted with implementing the AreaCalculator class with overloaded methods
- Helped write Javadoc comments and documentation
- Provided guidance on method overloading best practices in Java
- Assisted with exception handling implementation (IllegalArgumentException)
- Helped create the Main class to demonstrate the overloaded methods
- Reviewed code for proper parameter validation

**Key implementations assisted by Claude**:
1. AreaCalculator class with four overloaded `area()` methods:
   - `area(double radius)` for circles
   - `area(double width, double height)` for rectangles
   - `area(int base, int height)` for triangles
   - `area(int side)` for squares

2. Input validation using IllegalArgumentException for invalid dimensions

3. Main class demonstrating static method calls and exception handling
